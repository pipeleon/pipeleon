## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felipe LeÃ³n Giraldo and I'm a Software Developer and Civil Engineer passionate about technology and problem solving.

I've got 1.5 years of experience both in Personal and Freelance Projects, now currently working on a Devops solution for my first freelance project and Designing an ERP, both for a Logistics and Transportation Company.

My journey began at Holberton School's Bootcamp where I've got the opportunity to learn C programming Language, to interact in a Virtual Machine based in Ubuntu and making Bash Scritps. This made a a perfect base for web developing and the use of servers, all focused to develop Web applications. My Stack begin to growth with Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, configuring Web Servers with Nginx, and learning IT Infraestucture priciples. All of the efforts were going to an Airbnb Clone in which we desing a Backend with Flask and It was conected to MySQL database through an ORM (SQLALquemy), then making RESTFul API with the proper endpoints we need to serve a Frontend based on Javascript Vanilla to render some HTML templates.

Finally, there was the Capston Project and with my team Mekona we have the opportunity to work with the startup Opground to develop a feature for their website, this was the perfect closure for 9 months of learning the Foundations of Software Developing as we won at the National Demo Day for Cohort 16 in Holberton Colombia in July 2022.

Now, I've been doing some Freelance projects, first with a Inventory control System for a Warehouse where I got the oppotunnity to desing something from scratch and learning ReactJS as a very useful tool for the frontend component.

Here's my current Stack:
